Multimodal EEG + Eye Model Learning Improvement Version

- Feature extraction of EEG and Eye data with CNN and then fusion with Transformer and Cross-Modal Attention
- Reflect sequence sequence information with Positional Encoding
- Add BatchNormalization and Dropout to CNN models to improve generalization performance
- Test data segmentation remains sample-based

Each session can be modified as needed.
